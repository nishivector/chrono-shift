# Neural Net Nomads

## Game Description

"Neural Net Nomads" is a text-based survival/crafting game set in a post-AI singularity world. Players embody digital consciousnesses uploaded to a vast, ever-changing neural network after a catastrophic AI event. Your goal is to navigate this abstract digital landscape, gathering `Code Fragments` and `Energy`, crafting essential `tools` from code, and defending against rogue algorithms to survive and potentially find a way to manifest back into a physical form or a new digital paradise.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the game:** `python game.py`
2.  **Explore:** Type `explore` to search your current location for resources and potential threats.
3.  **Craft:** Type `craft [item]` (e.g., `craft basic_tool`) to create items from your collected resources. Use `recipes` to see available crafts and their costs.
4.  **Move:** Type `move [Location Name]` (e.g., `move Data Stream`) to travel to different nodes in the network. Be aware of your surroundings!
5.  **Meditate:** Type `meditate` to regain health at the cost of some energy.
6.  **Quit:** Type `quit` to exit the game.
