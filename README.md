### Game Mechanics

**Dual Timeline Control:**
You control two characters simultaneously - one in the past, one in the present. Each timeline has different physics:
- **Past:** Floaty, relaxed movement
- **Present:** Precise, snappy movement

**Temporal Sync:**
When both characters occupy the same horizontal position, they become "synchronized." Synchronized platforms glow green and allow you to solve puzzles that require cooperation between timelines.

**Objective:**
Reach the exit portal in both timelines to complete each level.
