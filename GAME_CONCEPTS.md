## Selected Concept: Chrono Shift

I select **Chrono Shift** because:
- Dual timeline mechanic is visually distinctive and offers unique puzzle possibilities
- Strong visual contrast between past (sepia/warm) and present (cool/digital) creates memorable aesthetics
- Platformer foundation provides satisfying gameplay while the time mechanic adds depth
- Technically achievable in a single HTML file with good performance
