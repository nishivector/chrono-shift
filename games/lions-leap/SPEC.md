# Lion's Leap - Game Spec

## Concept
A physics-based arcade game where a lioness must gently push her cubs across water gaps to safety. One-tap timing mechanic - hold to charge push, release to send cub flying.

## Core Mechanic
- Lioness on left side of screen
- Cub on platform next to her  
- Water/chasms between platforms
- Tap and hold to charge push power (visual indicator)
- Release to push cub
- Cub has physics - arcs through air, lands on platforms
- Goal: Get cub safely to the right side

## Visual Style
- Stylized low-poly aesthetic (Three.js)
- Warm sunset colors - oranges, pinks, purples
- Water with subtle waves
- Cute lion cub with big eyes
- Particle effects on landing

## Controls
- Mouse/touch: Hold to charge, release to push
- Spacebar: Hold to charge, release to push

## Progression
- Multiple levels with increasing gap distances
- Platforms at different heights
- Stars based on: landings, attempts, time

## Technical
- Single HTML file
- Three.js from CDN
- Cannon.js for physics (or simple custom physics)

## Memorable Moment
That perfect push where the cub does a beautiful arc and lands EXACTLY on the platform edge - extremely satisfying!
